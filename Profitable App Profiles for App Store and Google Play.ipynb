    "Unless more work is done on the data, I'd have to be very conservative with my recommendations. \n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>We assessed the number of user reviews associated with genres/categories, but that *doesn't* give us any insight about the range of values for apps *within* a given genre or category. If a particular game is a runaway hit (e.g. Genshin Impact, Candy Crush, Temple Runner) the userbase numbers for that game *do not imply* a guarantee that any app in the \"Games\" category will find a comparable userbase. In fact, in practice we see that there is usually a tremendous disparity between the user counts associated with top games and the user counts that are distributed amongst all other apps in that category.</li>\n",
    "    \n",
    "<li>I would be wary of giving the impression that all categories or genres are equally difficult to build. This is especially relevant considering that \"Games\" emerges as a prominent category in both the App Store and Google Play markets. Game design is a specialized field, and users have different expectations for what constitutes a \"good user experience.\" If the company wants to quickly produce an app for the market *and* that company does not have employees who are experienced with mobile game design, I would consider other options first. It would be prudent to assume that this could also hold true for other app categories.</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li>If we look at the top genres and categories for the App Store and Google Play, we'll find that practical apps factor heavily into the Google Play market but not so much within the App Store. However, enjoyment-based apps perform strongly in both marketplaces.</li>\n",

    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "I'd recommend the following as next steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Analyze the popularity of individual apps within genres of interest.\n",
    "        <ul>\n",
    "            <li>How does popularity seem to be distributed within the apps that belong to this genre?</li>\n",
    "            <li>Are there any noticeable patterns for popular and unpopular apps?</li>\n",
    "        </ul>\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "    <li>Consult with Subject Matter Experts about the viability of developing within particular genres, particularly:\n",
    "        <ul>\n",
    "            <li>Video Games</li>\n",
    "            <li>Social Media/Networking</li>\n",
    "        </ul>\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "    <li>Enhance the usefulness of the Google Play data by engineering high-level thematic categories and sorting the existing subcategories into the appropriate categories.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Once you've narrowed it down to two or three genres/categories, conduct additional analysis to identify subgenres/subcategories and the patterns associated with them.</li>\n",
    "</ul>"
